# Teaching Utilities

This repo contains a series of scripts written that I use to manage
my courses. There are so many repetitive tasks, some of which require
quite a bit of clicking and latency. 

Some of these tools are divided by use case (e.g. gradebook management,
plagiarism detection) or by tool (e.g. Canvas, Google Drive).

This is mainly a history for me, but I hope they are help to others.
