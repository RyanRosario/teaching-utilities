# Plagiarism Detection

I trust Measurement of Software Similarity (MOSS) over Gradescope's plagiarism detector.

Gradescope does not yet support plagiarism detection on Web Assignments yet.

* `submit-to-moss.py` allows submitting a series of files to MOSS because I can never remember
which script I used or its parameters.
* `gradescope-to-moss.py` takes the response from each exercise in a web assignment and produces
a flat file transcript of all responses. The content can be text or snippets of code. The output
can then be used with MOSS or other tools like `copydetect`.
* `gradescope-to-chatgpt.py` takes a flat file transcript and asks ChatGPT to evaluate the probability that
it was generated by ChatGPT or some kind of LLM. Several ChatGPT responses for the exercise are also returned
to help with manual investigation. 

Note that it is crucial to rename files and remove names and ID numbers before transferring to a tool.

Caution must be executed when using plagiarism detectors. Always manually review matches. There are many false positives.
